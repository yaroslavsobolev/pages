Yaroslav is an experimental physicist by training but recently prefers working 
as an interdisciplinary researcher. So far he only used this blog for 
publishing his data analysis of official voting results in Russia 
to reveal special types of vote rigging that occurred during 2020 referendum on 
constitutional amendments.
